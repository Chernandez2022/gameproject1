Trivia Quiz

Description:

This is the first Milestone Project for my coding bootcamp. This project is a quiz game that is built using Html and Javascript. The game consists of ten multiple choice questions and a result button at the end to see if you won or not.

Technologies/Information:
The user will have to install node modules using the command "npm install"
The user will also have to install Sass and a Sass compiler. The commands for these dependencies are "npm i -g sass" and the compiler can be found as a VSCode extension called "Live Sass Compiler"
You can run the application locally through the relative path or through the "Live Server" extension in VSCode.
This project is a work in progress and can definitely use some help if so inclined you can reach me at my email hcarlos0816@gmail.com.

Issues:
The main issues for this project is that it is incomplete, I am looking to keep working and refine this projec to bring it to it's best verison. Looking towards the future I would want to make some dynamic buttons for the questions and add a timer.

Thank you for your time :)
